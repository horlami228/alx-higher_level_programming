This directory contains all the python oop(object-oriented programming) project


1. 0-rectangle.py: write an empty class Rectangle

2. 1-rectangle.py: Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by: (based on 0-rectangle.py)
    ->> initialize a new rectangle object
    ->> use the property decorator(getter and setter) to get the correct input

3. 2-rectangle.py: Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by: (based on 1-rectangle.py)
    ->> create a public (area) method and a public (perimeter) method to get the rectangle area and perimeter respectively

4. 3-rectangle: Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by: (based on 2-rectangle.py)
    ->> use the __str__ function provided by python to display a string representation of the object
    ->> This creates something readable

5. 4-rectangle.py: Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by: (based on 3-rectangle.py)
    ->> use the __repr__ function to create a string representation of the official object
    ->> it can be used by the eval function to create a new object instance

6. 5-rectangle.py: Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by: (based on 4-rectangle.py)
    ->> use the __del__ function to delete a rectangle object
    ->> print out a "Bye rectangle..." message after deleting 

7. 6-rectangle.py: Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by: (based on 5-rectangle.py)
    ->> create a class attribute (number_of_instances) to keep track of created and deleted objects of the class

8. 7-rectangle.py: Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by: (based on 6-rectangle.py)
    ->> create a (symbol attribute) that can have any type
    ->> use the symbol as a string representation of the object in the __str__ function

9. 8-rectangle.py: Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by: (based on 7-rectangle.py)
    ->> This method is a static-method that compares two Rectangle object area to determine the biggest
    ->> A staticmethod is a special python method only for the class and not accessible by the instances of the class
    ->> A staticmethod don't have access to instance attributes or methods

10. 9-rectangle.py: Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by: (based on 8-rectangle.py)
    --> This is a class-method that is used to create a new instance of a Rectangle
    ->> The cls is used to represent the class itself
