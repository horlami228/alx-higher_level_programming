This function is to divide all elements in a matrix by a given element

A matrix is a rectangular grid of elements arranged in rows and columns. It consists of a collection of values, typically numbers, organized in a two-dimensional structure.

import the function
>>> matrix_divided = __import__("2-matrix_divided").matrix_divided


>>> matrix = [ [1, 2, 3], [2, 5, 6] ]

This is a list of list, but when the rows and columns are equal, it is referred specifically as a matrix

1. divide the matrix with an int number
>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 2))
[[0.5, 1.0, 1.5], [1.0, 2.5, 3.0]]

2. divide the matrix with a float number
>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3.5))
[[0.29, 0.57, 0.86], [0.57, 1.43, 1.71]]

>>> matrix = [ [1, 2, 3], ["lekan", 5, 6] ]

3. checking if the elements in a list contains int or float

>>> try:
...     print(matrix_divided(matrix, 5))
... except Exception as le:
...     print(le)
...
matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats


>>> matrix = [ [1, 2, 3], [2, 5, 6, 7] ]

4. check if the matrix is of the same size
>>> try:
...     print(matrix_divided(matrix, 5))
... except Exception as le:
...     print(le)
...
Each row of the matrix must have the same size


>>> matrix = [ [1, 2, 3], [2, 5, 6] ]

5. check if the division number is an integer/float

>>> try:
...     print(matrix_divided(matrix, "25"))
... except Exception as le:
...     print(le)
...
div must be a number

6. check if division number is 0

>>> try:
...     print(matrix_divided(matrix, 0))
... except Exception as le:
...     print(le)
...
division by zero

7. check if the existing matrix was not modified

print(matrix)
[[1, 2, 3], [2, 5, 6]]
